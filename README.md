# fontsize

Fontsize is a repository that was born from the desire to standardize and maintain an easy place to query font sizes with indications and explanations of use.

The idea is to couple it with some theming or standardization tool that can easily propagate these settings throughout the entire scope of a project. Separating them into divisions, for example h1, h2, h3, h4.
